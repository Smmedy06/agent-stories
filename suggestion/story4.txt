Wrapped in furs against the bitter cold, the lone wizard Elara stood over a shimmering celestial map, tracing its final inscription. 
The map suddenly glowed, projecting a faint blue line directly north toward the forbidding peak of Mount Glacius. Days later, struggling 
through a blinding blizzard near the mountain's base, she stumbled upon a massive, frozen waterfall concealing a dark, narrow cavern 
entrance marked by two crystalline spires. Inside, the silence was absolute as Elara navigated a maze of glowing ice tunnels, which led 
her to a chamber containing an enormous, clear crystal embedded in the floor, pulsating with a pale violet light. The moment Elara touched 
the crystal, the ice gave way, and she slid down a polished chute into a warm, subterranean vault filled with the low hum of colossal, 
derelict machinery. There, she beheld the Star Forge itself: a gigantic, intricately carved obsidian anvil suspended by chains of pure 
light. Realizing its dormant state, she drew upon the magic of the celestial map and channeled a stream of starlight into the anvil, 
causing the Forge to roar to life, casting intense, brilliant white light across the vault in a triumphant climax, its purpose now 
waiting to be fulfilled.
