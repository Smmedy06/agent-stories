He woke up on the floor with a nosebleed and the taste of rust in his mouth. The ceiling fan above him was still turning, slow and patient, like it had all the time in the world. His phone lay a few feet away, screen cracked, buzzing itself to death. Forty-seven missed calls. All from the same number.
Outside, the city was already loud. Vendors shouting, engines coughing, someone laughing too hard. Life moving forward without checking if he was ready.
He sat up and tried to remember what he had agreed to last night. There was a blur of faces, cheap lights, a handshake that lasted a second too long. He remembered saying yes because saying no felt dangerous. He remembered thinking he could fix it later.
The phone stopped buzzing. Silence rushed in, heavier than the noise had been.
He finally stood, washed his face in the sink, and watched diluted blood spiral down the drain. In the mirror, he looked ordinary. That was the worst part. Ordinary men disappear every day and nobody asks why.
When he stepped outside, the sun hit him like an accusation. Across the street, a black car idled. No plates. Windows dark. It hadn’t been there yesterday. He knew that the way you know when someone is standing too close behind you.
He walked anyway.
Each step felt like a negotiation with fate. Turn left, and maybe you’re late. Turn right, and maybe you never arrive. He chose straight ahead, because stopping would mean thinking, and thinking would mean fear.
The car followed at a distance. Polite. Professional.
At the end of the block, he reached the river. Brown water, thick with garbage and secrets. He leaned on the railing and let the wind slap his face. For a moment, he imagined climbing over, letting the current erase the problem. Clean. Final.
Instead, he took out his phone and deleted the missed calls. One by one. No ceremony.
The car door opened behind him. Footsteps approached. Calm. Unhurried.
He didn’t turn around.
“I’m ready,” he said, though he wasn’t sure what that meant.
The footsteps stopped. The river kept moving. The city kept breathing.
And whatever he had become, there was no going back now.
