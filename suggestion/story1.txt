The wind in the coastal town never stopped moving, as if it were afraid that stillness might make it forget. On the morning the boy 
decided to leave, he stood on the rooftop of his house and held a paper glider between his fingers, feeling the air test its wings. 
He had folded it years ago with someone whose face he could no longer recall clearly, only the sound of her laughter and the way she 
always leaned into the wind instead of away from it. People said memories faded because time demanded space for new ones, but the boy 
believed they faded because they were afraid of being carried too far. He had stayed longer than he meant to, returning each day to the 
same rooftop, releasing the same fragile gliders, watching them rise and fall like thoughts that refused to settle. The town below 
continued its quiet routines—fishermen mending nets, windmills creaking, waves pressing themselves against the shore as if asking to be 
let in. On his final morning, the wind grew stronger than usual. The glider tore at one edge, yet instead of falling, it rose higher 
than any before it. The boy ran down the stairs and through the streets, chasing the white flicker against the blue sky, until he reached 
the cliffs where the land finally gave up and became air. There, the wind caught the glider fully and carried it out over the sea, 
where it dissolved into distance. For the first time, the boy did not feel loss. He felt answered. He turned away from the ocean,
shouldered his bag, and walked toward the road leading out of town. Behind him, the wind kept moving—not to hold him, but to remember 
him.
